            My name is David Fernando, I’m a Data Analytics Major still in the process of figuring out what specific field interests me most. I’m relatively well versed with a wide variety of computer applications, such as digital music, graphic design, video editing and more. Since 2021, I have made over $20k through pursuing my online hobbies alone. I also won a couple of awards for computer applications in grade school. In my spare time, I love to make music, play tennis, stream, and play games with my friends.
