        <h1>Educational Background</h1>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m currently a Sophomore at Syracuse University studying Applied Data Analytics in the iSchool. I graduated High School with an Honors Regents Diploma, and a Mastery in Math and Science. I have coding experience with Python, C+, Java, HTML, and even took AP Computer Science during High Schoool. I've also gained practical experience introducing Middle Schoolers to the basics of Python programming.<br><br>

            On campus, I'm a member of the Phi Eta Sigma Honor Society, Filipino-Student Association, and Tennis Analytics Club.
